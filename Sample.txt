Tom Brady began his 23rd NFL season with plans on retiring at the end of the yearâ€”for real this time.

That may no longer be the case.

Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reported "all options are on the table" for Brady at the end of the 2022 season. The future Hall of Famer will be an unrestricted free agent in March and could consider leaving the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the right situation.

The Miami Dolphins were stripped of their 2023 first-round pick this offseason for tampering with Brady and former New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton. It's unlikely Miami pursues Brady this offseason amid Tua Tagovailoa's breakout.
